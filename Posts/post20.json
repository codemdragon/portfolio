This is a significant update, focusing on improving the overall conversational experience.</p>\n<h3>Persistent and Long-Term Memory</h3>\n<p>The assistant now features persistent memory, which means it retains context across sessions.</p>\n<p>I've integrated my Gemini Chromium API to facilitate this.</p>\n<p>The core functionality involves Ava summarising the ongoing conversation and outputting a one-line memory.</p>\n<p>This one-line summary is then saved as a long-term memory for Ava.</p>\n<p>Ava will retrieve and utilise this long-term memory every time a user prompt includes the statements 'remember when' or 'check'.</p>\n<p>I'm excited about the improved utility this persistent memory brings!
