  "content": "<h2>Project Overview</h2>\n<p>Using OpenCV, I had earlier implemented basic human detection as a command for the Central Hub. However, I encountered an issue where it constantly returned True for human presence.</p>\n<h3>The Challenge</h3>\n<p>Realizing this false positive was caused by a humanoid punching bag within the webcam's field of view, I had to refine the logic. It wasn't enough to just detect a 'person' shape.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>I updated the script to not only identify a person but also verify if the bounding box is moving. This logic allows the system to successfully differentiate between a living human and a static object.
