  "content": "<h2>Project Overview</h2>\n<p>Utilising Openrouter and a structured template, I am developing a specialized RPG AI designed for deep narrative immersion. This project involves significant planning and focuses on long-term scalability.</p>\n<h3>Narrative Structure</h3>\n<p>The system operates on a hierarchical story model. The Major Storyline serves as the unchanging guideline to ensure the AI never loses context. Between these pillars, the Minor Storyline is generated dynamically, providing on-the-spot relevance to the current situation.</p>\n<p>Player interaction is handled through specific options to maintain narrative flow. Additionally, the system includes Quests which are designed to improve NPC friendship and provide items without interfering with the core plot.</p>\n<h3>Future Features</h3>\n<p>Upcoming developments include complex systems for weather conditions, a functioning economy, and an inventory management system.</p>\n<p>You can <a href='https://codemsportfolio.netlify.app' target='_blank'>check out my portfolio</a> to see more projects.</p>"
