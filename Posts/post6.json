Thomas Edison used it in his notebooks in the 1870s to describe technical glitches.</p><p>However, Grace Hopper did popularize the term in computing when she literally found a moth stuck in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer in 1947. She taped the moth into the computer's logbook with the note \"First actual case of bug being found.\"</p><p>So while the term existed before, Grace Hopper's incident definitely helped cement \"debugging\" in the computing lexicon!</p>"
